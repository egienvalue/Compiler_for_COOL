This package contains five "task list" testcases for PA1 and their answers. 
These tests are meant to give you a place to get started and are not a
substitute for you coming up with your own test cases. We have many
held-out testcases; succeeding only at these five does not guarantee you a
good grade. 

The test cases are: 

100words.list   100 dictionary words interpreted as a task list; the
                answer involves pair-wise swapping the input since there
                are no repeated entries

ambig.list      a small example where alphabetic ordering must be used
                to break a tie 

austen.list     the first chapter of Jane Austen's _Pride And Prejudice_ 
                interpreted word-by-word as a task list. Thank you, Project
                Gutenberg. Anyway, it ends up having a cycle and it is
                bigger than the other testcases. 

century.list    a "human-readable" testcase; this one actually lists
                historical events (two per century) and is probably the
                most useful of the lot 

cycle.list      a test case with an obvious cycle 


Remember that all of your versions of Rosetta must give the same answer for
every testcase.
